2018-03-21 14:10:58 +0000,(iv) another problem chat bots have is keeping track of different level of contexts (and states) <SENTENCE> the system will be too complex by adding abilities of multiple state machines (jumping from one context to another in the middle of the conversation) <SENTENCE> (have not really solved it <EMOTICON> )
2018-03-21 14:08:07 +0000,(iii) conversational agent (like a faq bot) might well be simple to build using traditional rules and parsers <SENTENCE> but given the unstructured data currently neural net bot (based on lstm models) might be best suited <SENTENCE> but it comes with the consequences of availability of data
2018-03-21 14:06:16 +0000,(ii) the core problem lies in the amount of entities to be detected <SENTENCE> it is either lack of training set or the context itself <SENTENCE> (just repeating things you might now <EMOTICON> ) imho goal oriented bots are harder to formulate than a conversational agent
2018-03-21 14:03:30 +0000,(i) modern chat bots both either being goal oriented or conversational have their own limitations <SENTENCE> the first and foremost problem (from personal e<EMOTICON>erience) is you can not generalize everything <SENTENCE> it comes with the amount of dialogs or the action mapping or from the entities
